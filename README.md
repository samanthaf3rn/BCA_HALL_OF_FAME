SYBCA CLASS HALL OF FAME
A modern, interactive web-based gallery created to archive our class memories.
This project features a horizontal scrolling carousel and a custom-built JavaScript Lightbox for an immersive viewing experience.

Key Features:
1) Horizontal Carousel : Smooth, scroll-snap-enabled navigation
2) Custom lightbox: Clicky image in the gallery to view it in fullscreen.
3) Interactive navigation: Previous/Next button and keyboard support(Arrow keys/ esc)
4) Dynamic Counter: real-time slide tracking (e.g. 1/35)
5) Responsive design: optimized for both mobile and desktop viewing.

Tech Stack
1) HTML5: Semantic structure
2) CSS3: Custom variables(:root), flexbox and backdrop-filter for the blur effect.
3) JavaScript: DOM manipulation, event listeners, and array logic for gallery navigation.

How to Run
1) Clone the repository
2) Ensure all images (.jpeg files) are in the root folder
3) Open (index.html) in any web browser

Lessons Learned
During this project,\ 
I learned how to manage the DOM efficiently to create a Lightbox 
without using external libraries like jQuery and how to handle CSS z-indez layers for pop-up UI components."
